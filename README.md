### NightfallDLP - a code review tool that protects you from committing sensitive information

NightfallDLP scans your commits for secrets or sensitive information and posts review comments to your code hosting 
services automatically. Itâ€™s intended to be used as a part of your CI to simplify the development process, improve your 
security, and ensure you never accidentally leak secrets or other sensitive information via an accidental commit.

## Supported CI Services
### GithubActions
Example using the NightfallDLP Github Action inside a Github Workflow  
_(*N.B. you must use the actions/checkout step before the running the nightfalldlp action in order for it to function properly)_
```yaml
name: nightfalldlp
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
jobs:
  run-nightfalldlp:
    name: nightfalldlp
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo Action
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: nightfallDLP action step
        uses: nightfallai/nightfall_dlp_action@CreateAction
        env:
          NIGHTFALL_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.NIGHTFALL_API_KEY }}
          EVENT_BEFORE: ${{ github.event.before }}
```

**Configuration**  
NightfallDLP requires a few pieces of configuration to run  
_Config File (detectors)_  
    - place a `.nightfalldlp/` directory within the root of your target repository, and inside it a `config.json` file
    in which you can configure your detectors (see `Detectors` section below for more information on Detectors)
ex.
```json
{
    "detectors": {
        "CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER": "POSSIBLE",
        "PHONE_NUMBER": "LIKELY"
    }
}
```

_Supported Github Events_  
NightfallDLP can run in a Github Workflow triggered by the following events:
1) PULL_REQUEST
2) PUSH

_Env Variables_  
These variables should be made available to the nightfall_dlp_action by adding them to the `env:` key in your workflow
1) NIGHTFALL_API_KEY
    - get a (FREE) Nightfall API Key by registering an account with the Nightfall API HERE
    - add this variable to your target repository's "Github Secrets" and passed in to your Github Workflow's `env`.
    
2) EVENT_BEFORE (*only for running Github Workflows on a `push` event)
    - the value for this var lives on the `github` context object in a Workflow - EVENT_BEFORE should always point to
    `${{ github.event.before }}` (as seen in the example above)
    

## Detectors
Each detector represents a type of information you want to search for in your code scans (e.g. CRYPTOGRAPHIC_KEY). The 
configuration is a map of canonical detector names to their likelihoods (link to more info on our API Documentation). The 
`likelihood` you specify per detector serves as a floor in which any findings with likelihoods of equal or greater values will be flagged.
